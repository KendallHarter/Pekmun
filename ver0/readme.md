# Version 0

The majority of this code is awful since it was just written to get a handle
on GBA programming and such.

In order to successfully compile, the `process.py` script must be run within
the `script` directory and the output must be saved to `gba_ver/build/heck.hpp`

The Python version was made to prototype; it isn't as complete.

## Known glitches

Holding A upon startup will cause the tile data to not be loaded.

Switching names doesn't clear the full name.

I'm not going to fix any of these.
